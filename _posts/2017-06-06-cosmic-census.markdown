HELP Cosmic Censuses Meeting 2017
DATES: Mon 9th Oct - Fri 13th Oct 2017
LOCATION: University of Sussex, UK

Many international observatories have been conducting surveys of the
extragalactic sky at many wavelengths. Such surveys now cover 100s or 1000s of
square degrees at depths sufficient to detect many different astrophysical
phenomena through most of cosmic time and over volumes sufficient to provide
detailed statistics, probing representative environments and to detect rare and
transitory phenomena. This meeting is organised by the Herschel Extragalactic
Project (HELP) who are assembling data and tools to analyse data over the ~1200
deg^2 footprint of the Herschel surveys.

This workshop will explore the key scientific questions that can be addressed by
these surveys.

- The evolution of galaxy populations and their primary components (gas, stars, dust and active nuclei)
-  The influence of the internal and external environment on the evolution of the systems
- Exotica (extreme starbursts, lensed galaxies, high-z radio galaxies)
-  Building the tools to handle (evolving) multiwavelength data (SED models, deconvolution & multi-wavelength catalogs)
- Building the next generation panchromatic survey (larger area, new instruments)

The intention will be to have a meeting format that is conducive to discussion and practical interaction.
