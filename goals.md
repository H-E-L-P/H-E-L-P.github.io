## Project Description and Objectives

The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) intends to produce
a multi-wavelength, comprehensive data set of the galaxy population at high
redshift.  The Herschel Space Observatory has the unique property of being able
to probe the presence of star formation in extremely dusty galaxies through
observations of the far infrared and submillimetre portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum.  However, Herschel has relatively poor spatial
resolution, making it difficult to disentangle which galaxies are responsible
for what amount of flux.

HELP aims to robustly address this issue with the use of as many complimentary
data sets as possible.  With the inclusion of data at shorter wavelengths (such
as the optical, radio and near-infra-red), which have much higher spatial
resolution, the deblending of Herschel flux into component parts can be
undertaken in a much more robust, informed manner.   The ultimate goal of HELP
is to produce a multi-wavelength data set, which will be easy to use so that
astronomers not currently used to working with Herschel data or high redshift
surveys could make use of the statistical samples found within the HELP
catalogue.


## Expected Project Outcomes

Once HELP is completed we will have created an easily queried database of
sources in the high redshift sky, with data at multiple wavelengths, and
consistent, easily interpreted meta-data.  This sort of large scale, value added
data set has been previously produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
which has resulted in hundreds of publications and provided an invaluable data
set to the scientific community.  With HELP, we aim to produce a similar data
set for multi-wavelength data in the high redshift universe, whereas the SDSS
was limited to optical data in the low-redshift universe.  When completed, this
data set will be publicly available, and will permit more scientists to study
the high redshift Universe, adding to our understanding of the evolution of
galaxies from early times and the way our Universe has changed over time.
