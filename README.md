# H-E-L-P.github.io
HELP github webpage - notes on updating and maintaining it. The page is live here:

https://herschel.sussex.ac.uk/

Useful info on naming posts - the name really matters to make blog posts display properly,  useful for HELP events listing https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

## Aims of the site

We are in the process of updating the site. Some good example sites (although for larger projects) are:

- https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/ (JWST user guide) Very detailed overview.
- https://pipelines.lsst.io/ (LSST Science Pipelines) good introduction to using LSST software.

We want the main site to link to all the various other sites but also offer a very simple introduction to the HELP project.
